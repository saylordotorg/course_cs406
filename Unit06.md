**Unit 6: Firewalls, Intrusion Detection, and Intrusion Prevention**
<span id="6"></span> 
In this unit, we will explore the use of security tools such as
firewalls and intrusion prevention systems. Following a quick
introduction to the concepts of intranet and extranet systems that are
frequently used for information exchange by enterprises today, we will
look into cryptographic concepts related to securing communication using
firewalls. We will explore how firewalls work and will also study
different types of intrusion detection systems including host-based and
network-based systems.

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 9 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.1: 1 hour

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to
-   explain the basic idea behind firewalls and how they work;
-   explain the basic idea behind intrusion prevention systems and how
    they work; and
