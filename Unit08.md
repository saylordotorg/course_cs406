**Unit 8: Malicious Software and Software Security** <span
id="8"></span> 
*In this unit, we will explore malicious software, also known as
malware. We will also study common software security issues such as
buffer overflow, used by several malware to exploit systems’
vulnerability. At the end of the unit, we will learn how to use these
malware and other security attacks to carry out information warfare.*

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to  
-   explain malicious software and list by type;
-   explain typical software solutions used in dealing with viruses and
    worms;
-   explain common software security issues such as buffer overflow;
-   explain denial of service and distributed denial of service attacks;
    and
