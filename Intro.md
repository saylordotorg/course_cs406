Course Syllabus for "CS406: Information Security"
-------------------------------------------------

This course focuses on the fundamentals of information security that are
used in protecting both the information present in computer storage as
well as information traveling over computer networks. Interest in
information security has been spurred by the pervasive use of
computer-based applications such as information systems, databases, and
the Internet. Information security has also emerged as a national goal
in the United States and in other countries with national defense and
homeland security implications. Information security is enabled through
securing data, computers, and networks. In this course, we will look
into such topics as fundamentals of information security, computer
security technology and principles, access control mechanisms,
cryptography algorithms, software security, physical security, and
security management and risk assessment. By the end of this course, you
will be able to describe major information security issues and trends,
and advise an individual seeking to protect his or her data.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to

-   explain the challenges and scope of information security;
-   explain such basic security concepts as confidentiality, integrity,
    and availability, which are used frequently in the field of
    information security;
-   explain the importance of cryptographic algorithms used in
    information security in the context of the overall information
    technology (IT) industry;
-   identify and explain symmetric algorithms for encryption-based
    security of information;
-   identify and explain public-key based asymmetric algorithms for
    encryption-based security of information;
-   describe the access control mechanism used for user authentication
    and authorization;
-   describe Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) as a common solution enabling
    security of many applications, including all Internet-based
    commerce;
-   describe securing Internet Protocol (IP) communications by using
    Internet Protocol Security (IPSec);
-   explain the importance of physical security and discuss ways to
    improve physical security of an enterprise;
-   explain the use of such security tools as firewalls and intrusion
    prevention systems;
-   explain malicious software issues such as those introduced by
    software-based viruses and worms;
-   explain common software security issues such as buffer overflow; and
-   describe the basic process of risk assessment in the context of
    overall IT security management.

### Course Requirements

In order to take this course, you must  
  
 √    have access to a computer;  
  
 √    have continuous broadband Internet access;  
  
 √    have the ability/permission to install plug-ins or software (e.g.,
Adobe Reader or Flash);  
  
 √    have the ability to download and save files and documents to a

computer science discipline;  
  
 √    feel comfortable in writing, compiling, and executing your own
programs; and  
  
 √    have knowledge about the basics of discrete mathematics concepts
from the Discrete Structures
([CS202](http://www.saylor.org/courses/cs202/)) course and the course on
Algorithms ([CS303](http://www.saylor.org/courses/cs303/)).

### Course Information

Welcome to CS406, Information Security. General information about this
course and its requirements can be found below.  
  
 **Course Designer:** Dr. Bhanu Kapoor  
  
 **Primary Resources:** This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   YouTube: IIT Kharagpur Lecture Series on Internet Technologies: Dr.
    Indranil Sengupta’s [Lecture
    Series](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA_ZmWPormM)
-   Naval Postgraduate School: CyberCiege: [“Cryptography
    Basics”](http://www.cisr.us/cyberciege/movies/07CIEGE.html)
-   Gary C. Kessler’s [*An Overview of
    Cryptography*](http://www.garykessler.net/library/crypto.html#pkc)
-   CGISecurity: The Open Web Application Security Project’s [*A Guide
    to Building Secure Web
    Applications*](http://www.cgisecurity.com/owasp/html/index.html)
-   Ross Anderson: [Security
    Engineering](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Pay special attention to Unit 1, as this unit will lay the groundwork
for understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in
the later units. You will also need to complete the Final Exam.  
  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the materials in each unit.  
  
 In order to *pass* this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again
following a 14-day waiting period.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of
approximately **76 hours** to complete. Each unit includes a *time
advisory* that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on
each subunit. These advisories should help you plan your time
accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at these time advisories
and to determine how much time you have over the next few weeks to
complete each unit, and then to set goals for yourself. For example,
Unit 1 should take you 6.5 hours. Perhaps you can sit down with your
calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1 and 1.2 (a total of 2.5
hours) on Monday night; subunits 1.3 and 1.4 (a total of 2.5 hours) on
Tuesday night; etc.
