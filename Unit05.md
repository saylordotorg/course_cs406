**Unit 5: Security Solutions** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, we explore some of the common solutions for security
issues that are currently in use. For securing web-based applications
such as e-Commerce, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a commonly used
solution to enable security of transactions. It makes use of public-key
based encryption and symmetric encryption during the transaction to
ensure security. We also look into a protocol called Internet Protocol
Security (IPSec) to secure communications.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 5.5 hours to complete.

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to
-   explain the need for security protocols in the context of use with
    Internet-based applications;
-   describe how Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) enables security of several
    internet-based applications;
-   describe how Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) secures
    communications over the Internet; and
