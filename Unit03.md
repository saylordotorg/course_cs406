**Unit 3: Public-Key Encryption** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, we explore basic cryptography concepts and look into the
details of asymmetric key encryption techniques based on the concepts of
a public-key. You will be able to compare and contrast public-key
algorithms and symmetric algorithms discussed in Unit 2. In particular,
we will discuss the public-key algorithms by Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman
(RSA) and another algorithm by Diffie and Hellman.*

     Instructions: Please click the link above, and watch this video to
    gain an understanding of origins of cryptographic concepts.
    Whitfield Diffie, a key figure in the discovery of public-key
    cryptography, traces the growth of information security through the
    20th century and into the 21st. In the 1970s, the world of
    information security was transformed by public-key cryptography, the
    radical revision of cryptographic thinking that allowed people with
    no prior contact to communicate securely. Public-key solved security
    problems born of the revolution in information technology that
    characterized the 20th century and made Internet commerce possible.
    Security problems rarely stay solved, however. Continuing growth in
    computing, networking, and wireless applications have given rise to
    new security problems that are already confronting us.
