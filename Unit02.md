**Unit 2: Basic Cryptographic Concepts** <span id="2"></span> 
*Encryption and decryption of data form the basis of information
security. Cryptography is the science of encrypting data. In this unit,
we will explore basic cryptography concepts and the purpose of
cryptography. Also, we will look into the details of symmetric key
encryption techniques. In particular, we will discuss the symmetric key
algorithms called Data Encryption Standard (DES), Triple DES, and
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). DES is a block-cipher employing a
56-bit key that operates on 64-bit blocks. Triple-DES is a variant of
DES that employs up to three 56-bit keys and makes three
encryption/decryption passes over the block. In 1997, NIST initiated a
very public, four-and-a-half-year process to develop a new secure
cryptosystem for U.S. government applications. The result, the [Advanced
Encryption Standard](http://www.nist.gov/aes), became the official
successor to DES in December 2001. *
