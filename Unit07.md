**Unit 7: Physical Security** <span id="7"></span> 
*Physical securityis the protection of personnel, hardware, programs,
networks, and data from physical circumstances and events that could
cause serious losses or damage. This unit explains the importance of
physical security as a significant item in providing overall security.
Without physical security, all other sophisticated techniques can become
useless. Specifically, we will study the NASA physical security program,
which is a result of extensive research on physical security. We will
also look into different types of attacks that are possible in the
context of physical security.*

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to
-   explain the importance of physical security;
-   list a number of ways to improve physical security of an enterprise;
-   explain NASA’s physical security program and key recommendations
    from this program; and
-   explain the security issue behind social engineering.

**7.1 Physical Security** <span id="7.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory: Ross
    Anderson’s Security Engineering: “Chapter 10: Monitoring Systems”
    and “Chapter 11: Physical Protection”**
    Link: University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory: Ross Anderson’s
    *Security Engineering*: [“Chapter 10: Monitoring
    Systems”](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/) (PDF) and
    [“Chapter 11: Physical
    Protection”](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SEv2-c11.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the link above and then download *SE-10.pdf*
    and *SEv2-c11.pdf* to read the chapters. After reading these
    chapters, explain the relationship between threat models and
    attacks. Take the communication examples in the chapters and try to
    explain different attacks based on different assumption of threat
    models.  
      
     Reading these chapters should take approximately 4 hours.

    (HTML or PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please click the link above and read this webpage to
    gain an understanding of NASA’s physical security program. Physical
    security in IT context requires most of the ideas discussed here,
    even though they were developed in the context of NASA’s
    requirements. Please note that you have the option to download this
    document as a PDF by clicking the *Printable Format (PDF)* link at
    the top right of the webpage.  
      
     Reading this webpage should take approximately 2 hours.
