**Unit 4: Access Control Mechanisms** <span id="4"></span> 
*Access control is a system that enables an authority to control access
to areas and resources in a given physical facility or computer-based
information system. In this unit, we will explore the access control
mechanisms for user authorization. By the means of access control,
appropriate authorization to information is provided to different
entities in an organization. The common mechanisms include discretionary
access control (DAC) and role-based access control (RBAC). We look into
each of these in the context of their current usage in a typical
enterprise.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**

 ☐    Subunit 4.4: 1 hour

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to  
-   differentiate between authentication and authorization;
-   explain the basic idea behind access control;
-   explain various elements of discretionary access control (DAC); and
-   explain various elements of role-based access control (RBAC).
