**Unit 1: Computer Security Concepts** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit provides an overview of information security. First, we look
at the basic concepts of confidentiality, integrity, and availability as
discussed in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
standard Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199. We will
discuss threats, attacks, and assets in the overall context of a
security management model. We will also learn about the challenges of
information security and its overall scope. *

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 6.5 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.1: 1.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.2: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.3: 1 hour

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to  
-   explain the meaning and importance of information security;
-   explain the ideas behind the basic security concepts as
    confidentiality, integrity, and availability;
-   explain the concepts of data and network security as different
    aspects of information security;
-   list the key objectives behind securing information and information
    systems; and
-   list some examples of information assets and associated threats.

     Instructions: Please watch this video to learn about the methods
    for managing risks to information assets. IT practitioners seek to
    protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and
    their delivery systems –  whether the data are in storage, in
    processing, or in transit, and whether threatened by malice or
    accident.  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 1 hour.
